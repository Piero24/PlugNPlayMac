<h2 id="itroduction">üìî  Itroduction</h2>
<p>
    This is a script that automates tasks when you connect a device to your Mac.
    Let's add some context to the project!
    <br/>
    I have written this shell script to automate tasks when I return home and connect my Mac to an external monitor. Every time I connect my Mac to the monitor, I have to perform several tasks:
    <ul>
        <li>Run <a href="https://github.com/MonitorControl/MonitorControl">MonitorControl</a> to adjust the external monitor's brightness.</li>
        <li>Launch <a href="https://www.elgato.com/us/en/s/downloads">Elgato Stream Deck.</a></li>
        <li>Start <a href="https://www.google.com/drive/download/">Google Drive</a> to access my files.</li>
        <li>Activate <a href="https://apps.apple.com/bg/app/amphetamine/id937984704?mt=12">Amphetamine</a> to prevent my Mac from going to sleep.</li>
        <li>Run <a href="https://github.com/AppHouseKitchen/AlDente-Charge-Limiter">AlDente</a> to preserve battery health.</li>
    </ul>
    This process was very frustrating because I had to perform these tasks manually every time. Furthermore, each time I disconnected the monitor, I had to repeat these operations to close all the apps.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    With this script, the apps will open automatically when I connect my home monitor to the MacBook and will close when I disconnect the monitor. Additionally, it recognizes the Wi-Fi network, so it only opens the apps when I connect to a specific home monitor. This ensures that nothing opens if I connect to an external monitor at the office with a similar name.
    <br/>
    <br/>

    <br/>
    <br/>
    In addition to this, I have also prepared a shortcut (for the <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/shortcuts-mac/apdf22b0444c/mac">Apple Shortcut app</a>) to enable/disable various functions from the Mac's menu bar. This allows me to control the functions even when I am not at home. While there are apps that perform similar functions, I wanted to minimize the number of applications running constantly in the background. Therefore, I chose to write a script to accomplish all of this.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I have also opted to replace <a href="https://apps.apple.com/bg/app/amphetamine/id937984704?mt=12">Amphetamine</a> with <a href="https://ss64.com/osx/caffeinate.html">Caffeinate</a>, which is pre-installed on every Mac. Additionally, I replaced <a href="https://github.com/AppHouseKitchen/AlDente-Charge-Limiter">AlDente</a> with <a href="https://github.com/zackelia/bclm">bclm</a>, which has fewer features but is more convenient for my purposes.

<p>
    The script consists of 3 .sh files, 1 .swift file, and 1 .plist file. The .plist file is necessary to launch the script at Mac startup. The .swift file is required to limit battery charging. The 3 .sh files contain the script's code.
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>PlugNPlayMac.sh</strong> is the main script that runs when the monitor is connected. This script handles the opening of all necessary apps and starts `caffeinate` and `bclm` to limit battery charging.
        </li>
        <br/>
        <li>
            <strong>PNPMacParam.sh</strong> contains configurable settings for the script, such as which apps to open, the names of monitors and Wi-Fi networks that trigger the script, and the battery limit for `bclm`.
        </li>
        <br/>
        <li>
            <strong>PNPMacInstaller.sh</strong> is the installation file (currently responsible for moving files to the correct paths, although some manual steps are required). In future versions, efforts will be made to automate the installation process as much as possible, even though certain functions, such as disk access, may still need to be performed manually.
        </li>
        <br/>
        <li>
            <strong>com.launch.plug.and.play.mac.plist</strong> is responsible for launching the script at Mac startup. In a future version, it will be integrated into the main file, which will automatically write it to the LaunchAgents folder, eliminating the need for manual copying in case it is accidentally deleted.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <br/>
    In case of any errors, you can check the logs in the file <strong>plug.and.play.mac.log</strong> located in the folder <strong>/tmp/plug.and.play.mac.log</strong>.

<h2 id="prerequisites"><br/>üß∞  Prerequisites</h2>
<p>
    There are no specific dependencies or requirements to be met for using this script.
    The only thing required is to have a Mac with <strong>macOS Ventura</strong> (or higher) installed. Additional requirements may apply to <a href="https://github.com/zackelia/bclm">bclm</a>, so please check the original repository before proceeding with the installation.
    <p>
        <strong>NOTE: </strong> This script has been tested only on <strong>MacBook Pro (13-inch, 2018, Four Thunderbolt 3 ports)</strong> with <strong>macOS Ventura 13.5.1</strong> and <strong>macOS Sonoma 14.0</strong>.

            <strong>Currently, bclm works exclusively on Macs with Intel processors and not on Macs with Apple Silicon processors (M1, M2, etc)</strong>. The rest of the functions work without any issues, so Caffeinate and the apps will start as expected, but bclm won't run. As soon as I have access to a Mac with an Apple Silicon processor, I will update the code to support these processors. Otherwise, if anyone would like to contribute, they are welcome to do so.

<h2 id="how-to-start"><br/>‚öôÔ∏è  How to Start</h2>
<p>
    Here you can find a step by step guide to install and run the script. At the end of this section you can find a link to a <strong><a href="https://github.com/Piero24/PlugNPlayMac/blob/main/.github/markdown/QandA.md">Q&A</a></strong> page that provide some extra information like <strong>change the password</strong>, how to <strong>add more displays</strong>, <strong>download the shortcut</strong>, etc.
</p>
<br/>


1. Download the latest version of the script from <a href="https://github.com/Piero24/PlugNPlayMac/archive/refs/heads/main.zip">here</a> or clone the repo:
    ```sh
        git clone https://github.com/Piero24/PlugNPlayMac.git
    ```

2. Open the terminal and run the installer:
    ```sh
        ./PlugNPlayMac/PNPMacInstaller.sh
    ```

3. Give the script the Full Disk Access <strong>(Mandatory for run it correctly)</strong>:
    - Open `System Settings > Privacy & Security > Full Disk Access`
    - Add `/bin/bash` and `/usr/local/bin/PlugNPlayMac/blcm`

    > **A step by step guide can be found <a href="https://github.com/Piero24/PlugNPlayMac/blob/main/.github/markdown/fullDiskAccess.md">here</a>.**
4. Reboot your Mac

5. Open the terminal and run again the installer:
    ```sh
        ./PlugNPlayMac/PNPMacInstaller.sh
    ```

**Done!** Now the script will run automatically when you connect your Mac to the monitor and will close when you disconnect it. Additionally, you can use the <strong>shortcut</strong> to enable/disable various functions from the Mac's menu bar.
