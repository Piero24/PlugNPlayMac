### NOTE:
If you want to delete the password from keychain, you can do it in this way:
As mentioned [here](https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/344380/460842) there is a bug on macOS that doesn't allow to delete the password from keychain if you have searched it on the search bar. So, if you want to delete the password, you have to do remove the name **PlugNPlayMac** from the search bar and then searching it manually.
