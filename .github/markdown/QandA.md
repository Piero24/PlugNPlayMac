<summary>5) How can I change the battery level ?</summary>
<br/>

1. Open the `PNPMacParam.sh` file and edit the following variables:
2. Change the value of batteryValue with the one in range 50-95 (100 only if you don't want to have the battery limit)
3. Save exit and restart the script with the command:
```sh 
launchctl unload /Library/LaunchAgents/com.launch.plug.and.play.mac.plist
launchctl load /Library/LaunchAgents/com.launch.plug.and.play.mac.plist
```

**NOTE:** The `batteryValue` of <a href="https://github.com/zackelia/bclm">bclm</a> as mentioned it will be 3 point greather then the value setted in the script. So if you set `batteryValue=77` the battery limit will be 80.

If somthing you can try to find a solution by checking the log file `/private/tmp/plug.and.play.mac.log`

If the problem is not correlated to a wrong password or a wrong name of the display you can open an issue <a href="https://github.com/Piero24/PlugNPlayMac/issues">here</a> and post the result of the log file.

### You Can't.
> Just kidding ðŸ˜‚ of corse you can delete it.

You can do it by deleting the following files:
- `/Library/LaunchAgents/com.launch.plug.and.play.mac.plist`

- `/usr/local/bin/PlugNPlayMac` (DELETE THE ENTIRE FOLDER)

- Remember to remove bash and bclm from `System Settings > Privacy & Security > Full Disk Access`
