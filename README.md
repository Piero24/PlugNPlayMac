<h2 id="itroduction">üìî  Itroduction</h2>
<p>
    This is a script that automates tasks when you connect a device to your Mac.
    Let's add some context to the project!
    <br/>
    I have written this shell script to automate tasks when I return home and connect my Mac to an external monitor. Every time I connect my Mac to the monitor, I have to perform several tasks:
    <ul>
        <li>Run <a href="https://github.com/MonitorControl/MonitorControl">MonitorControl</a> to adjust the external monitor's brightness.</li>
        <li>Launch <a href="https://www.elgato.com/us/en/s/downloads">Elgato Stream Deck.</a></li>
        <li>Start <a href="https://www.google.com/drive/download/">Google Drive</a> to access my files.</li>
        <li>Activate <a href="https://apps.apple.com/bg/app/amphetamine/id937984704?mt=12">Amphetamine</a> to prevent my Mac from going to sleep.</li>
        <li>Run <a href="https://github.com/zackelia/bclm">bclm</a> to preserve battery health.</li>
    </ul>
    This process was very frustrating because I had to perform these tasks manually every time. Furthermore, each time I disconnected the monitor, I had to repeat these operations to close all the apps.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    With this script, the apps will open automatically when I connect my home monitor to the MacBook and will close when I disconnect the monitor. Additionally, it recognizes the Wi-Fi network, so it only opens the apps when I connect to a specific home monitor. This ensures that nothing opens if I connect to an external monitor at the office with a similar name.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <img src="https://github.com/Piero24/PlugNPlayMac/blob/main/image/Cover.png">
    <br/>
    <br/>
    In addition to this, I have also prepared a shortcut (for the <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/shortcuts-mac/apdf22b0444c/mac">Apple Shortcut app</a>) to enable/disable various functions from the Mac's menu bar. This allows me to control the functions even when I am not at home. While there are apps that perform similar functions, I wanted to minimize the number of applications running constantly in the background. Therefore, I chose to write a script to accomplish all of this.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I have also opted to replace <a href="https://apps.apple.com/bg/app/amphetamine/id937984704?mt=12">Amphetamine</a> with <a href="https://ss64.com/osx/caffeinate.html">Caffeinate</a>, which is pre-installed on every Mac. Additionally, I replaced <a href="https://github.com/AppHouseKitchen/AlDente-Charge-Limiter">AlDente</a> with <a href="https://github.com/zackelia/bclm">bclm</a>, which has fewer features but is more convenient for my purposes.

<p>
    The script consists of 3 .sh files, 1 .swift file, and 1 .plist file. The .plist file is necessary to launch the script at Mac startup. The .swift file is required to limit battery charging. The 3 .sh files contain the script's code.
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>PlugNPlayMac.sh</strong> is the main script that runs when the monitor is connected. This script handles the opening of all necessary apps and starts `caffeinate` and `bclm` to limit battery charging.
        </li>
        <br/>
        <li>
            <strong>PNPMacParam.sh</strong> contains configurable settings for the script, such as which apps to open, the names of monitors and Wi-Fi networks that trigger the script, and the battery limit for `bclm`.
        </li>
        <br/>
        <li>
            <strong>PNPMacInstaller.sh</strong> is the installation file (currently responsible for moving files to the correct paths, although some manual steps are required). In future versions, efforts will be made to automate the installation process as much as possible, even though certain functions, such as disk access, may still need to be performed manually.
        </li>
        <br/>
        <li>
            <strong>com.launch.plug.and.play.mac.plist</strong> is responsible for launching the script at Mac startup. In a future version, it will be integrated into the main file, which will automatically write it to the LaunchAgents folder, eliminating the need for manual copying in case it is accidentally deleted.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <br/>
    In case of any errors, you can check the logs in the file <strong>plug.and.play.mac.log</strong> located in the folder <strong>/tmp/plug.and.play.mac.log</strong>.

<h2 id="prerequisites"><br/>üß∞  Prerequisites</h2>
<p>
    There are no specific dependencies or requirements to be met for using this script.
    The only thing required is to have a Mac with <strong>macOS Ventura</strong> (or higher) installed. Additional requirements may apply to <a href="https://github.com/zackelia/bclm">bclm</a>, so please check the original repository before proceeding with the installation.
    <p>
        <strong>NOTE: </strong> This script has been tested only on <strong>MacBook Pro (13-inch, 2018, Four Thunderbolt 3 ports)</strong> with <strong>macOS Ventura 13.5.1</strong> and <strong>macOS Sonoma 14.0</strong>.

            <strong>Currently, bclm works exclusively on Macs with Intel processors and not on Macs with Apple Silicon processors (M1, M2, etc)</strong>. The rest of the functions work without any issues, so Caffeinate and the apps will start as expected, but bclm won't run. As soon as I have access to a Mac with an Apple Silicon processor, I will update the code to support these processors. Otherwise, if anyone would like to contribute, they are welcome to do so.

<h2 id="how-to-start"><br/>‚öôÔ∏è  How to Start</h2>
<p>
    Below is an example of how you can instruct your audience on installing and setting up your app. This template doesn't rely on any external dependencies or services.
</p>
<br/>


1. Download the latest version of the script from <a href="https://github.com/Piero24/PlugNPlayMac/archive/refs/heads/main.zip">here</a> or clone the repo:
    - ```sh
        git clone https://github.com/Piero24/PlugNPlayMac.git
        ```
2. Connect the macbook to your wifi and monitor open the terminal and run the following commands:
    - ```sh
        ioreg -lw0 | grep 'IODisplayEDID' | sed '/[^<]*</s///' | xxd -p -r | strings -10
        ```
        It will return the name of the monitor seen by the Mac. In my case, it is `LG IPS FULLHD`.
    - ```sh
        /Sy*/L*/Priv*/Apple8*/V*/C*/R*/airport -I | awk '/ SSID:/ {print $2}'
        ```
        It will return the name of the wifi seen by the Mac. In my case, it is `Home-Wifi-Name`.

3. Open the `PNPMacParam.sh` file and edit the following variables:
    - ```sh
        listWifiNames=("Wifi Name" "Other Wifi Name") 
        ```
    - ```sh
        listDisplayNames=("Display Name" "Other Display Name")
        ```
    - ```sh
        listAppToOpen=("App Name" "Other App Name")
        ```
    - ```sh
        batteryValue=77
        ```
    - ```sh
        accountUser="User Name"
        ```
    Where `listWifiNames` is the list of Wi-Fi networks and `listDisplayNames` are the list of monitors that trigger the script, `listAppToOpen` is the list of apps to open, `batteryValue` is the battery limit for `bclm` (must be less or equal to 100), and `accountUser` is the name of the user account on your Mac. So in my case, the values are:
    ```sh
        listWifiNames=("Home-Wifi-Name")
        listDisplayNames=("LG IPS FULLHD")
        listAppToOpen=("MonitorControl" "Elgato Stream Deck")
        batteryValue=77
        accountUser="MY USERNAME"
    ```
    Where `Home-Wifi-Name`and `LG IPS FULLHD` are the values founded before, `MonitorControl` and `Elgato Stream Deck` are the apps to open, `77` is the battery limit for `bclm`, and `MY USERNAME` is the name of the user account on my Mac. You can add as mach wifi, monitor, and app you want.
 

    **NOTE:** The `batteryValue` of <a href="https://github.com/zackelia/bclm">bclm</a> as mentioned it will be 3 point greather then the value setted in the script. So if you set `batteryValue=77` the battery limit will be 80.

4. Add the password to keychain (this is needed for run persistence on bclm and perceive other task):
    - ```sh
        security add-generic-password -s 'PlugNPlayMac'  -a 'MY USERNAME' -w 'MY MACBOOK PASSWORD'
        ```
        `MY USERNAME` is the name of the user account on my Mac and `MY MACBOOK PASSWORD` is the password of my Mac. It will be stored on keychain with the name `PlugNPlayMac` and will be used by the script to run the task.
        
    Alternativelly you can add the password manually on keychain in this way:

    - Open Keychain Access 
        
        <img src="https://github.com/Piero24/PlugNPlayMac/blob/main/image/KeychainAccessIcon.png" width="100" height="100">
    
    - Select Open Keychain Access 
        
        <img src="https://github.com/Piero24/PlugNPlayMac/blob/main/image/OpenedKey.png">
    
    - Add the new password
        
        <img src="https://github.com/Piero24/PlugNPlayMac/blob/main/image/NewPass.png">

5. Open the terminal ad run the installer:
    - ```sh
        /Users/YOUR-NAME/Downloads/PlugNPlayMac-main/PNPMacInstaller.sh
        ```
        Where `YOUR-NAME` is the name of your user account on your Mac.

6. Give the script the Full Disk Access (Mandatory for run it correctly):
    - Open System Settings > Privacy & Security > Full Disk Access
    - Click on the plus icon at the bottom of the list and digit your password
        
        <img src="https://github.com/Piero24/PlugNPlayMac/blob/main/image/BeforeFullDisk.png">

    - Press cmd + shift + G and digit /bin

        <img src="https://github.com/Piero24/PlugNPlayMac/blob/main/image/bin.png">

    - Select bash and click open
    - Click again on the plus icon at the bottom of the list and digit your password
    - Press cmd + shift + G and digit /usr/local/bin/PlugNPlayMac

        <img src="https://github.com/Piero24/PlugNPlayMac/blob/main/image/bash.png">

    - Select blcm and click open

    This is the final result:

    <img src="https://github.com/Piero24/PlugNPlayMac/blob/main/image/AfterFullDisk.png">

7.  Test the script (the pass it will be required only the first time you run the script):
    - Digit on therminal `/usr/local/bin/PlugNPlayMacPlugNPlayMac.sh` ad enter your password
    - Control + c to exit 

8. Reboot your Mac

9. Open terminal and digit `launchctl load /Library/LaunchAgents/com.launch.plug.and.play.mac.plist``

Done! Now the script will run automatically when you connect your Mac to the monitor and will close when you disconnect it. Additionally, you can use the shortcut to enable/disable various functions from the Mac's menu bar.
